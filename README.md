# Welcome to My Computer Architecture & RTL Design Repository ðŸ‘‹  

## About This Repository  
This repository contains a collection of **[Computer Architecture](#computer-architecture-projects), [Verification](#verification-projects), and [RTL Design](#rtl-design-projects)** implementations that I have worked on as part of my academic and professional journey.  

## About Me  
Hi, I'm **Praful Kharade**, an **Electrical Engineering graduate student at UT Dallas**, passionate about **RTL design, verification, and digital system development**. I specialize in **ASIC design flow, FPGA implementations, and hardware verification methodologies**.

## ðŸ”¹ [Computer Architecture Projects](#computer-architecture-projects) ðŸš€  
### **[16-Bit UART Serial Communication (RTL to GDS Flow)](Computer_Architecture/16-Bit_UART/)**  
- Designed a UART in Verilog with CDC handling and implemented standard cell optimizations using Cadence tools.  

### **[FPGA-Accelerated Sobel Edge Detection](Computer_Architecture/FPGA_Sobel_Edge/)**  
- Implemented Sobel edge detection using Verilog, HLS, and Cyclone V SoC, optimizing performance with HPS-FPGA communication.

## ðŸ”¹ [Verification Projects](#verification-projects) ðŸ›   
### **[SystemVerilog Verification of FIFO & I2C](Verification/FIFO_I2C_Verification/)**  
- Developed testbenches, assertions (SVA), and functional coverage for digital systems.  

### **[Structured Verification Environments](Verification/FIFO_I2C_Verification/)**  
- Created verification setups incorporating randomized stimulus, protocol adherence checks, and coverage-driven testing.

## ðŸ”¹ [RTL Design Projects](#rtl-design-projects) âš¡  
### **[Custom Processor RTL Design](RTL_Design/Custom_Processor/)**  
- Designed and optimized hardware architectures using **Verilog/SystemVerilog**.  
- Experience in **timing analysis, power optimization, and placement & routing** (Cadence Innovus).  
- Worked with **protocols like UART, I2C, SPI, APB, and AMBA**.
