# Welcome to My Computer Architecture & RTL Design Repository 👋  

## About This Repository  
This repository contains a collection of **Computer Architecture projects, Verification projects, and RTL Design implementations** that I have worked on as part of my academic and professional journey.  

## About Me  
Hi, I'm **Praful Kharade**, an **Electrical Engineering graduate student at UT Dallas**, passionate about **RTL design, verification, and digital system development**. I specialize in **ASIC design flow, FPGA implementations, and hardware verification methodologies**.  

## Projects Covered in This Repository 🚀  

### 🔹 Computer Architecture Projects  
- **16-Bit UART Serial Communication (RTL to GDS Flow)**  
  - Designed a UART in Verilog with CDC handling and implemented standard cell optimizations using Cadence tools.  
- **FPGA-Accelerated Sobel Edge Detection**  
  - Implemented Sobel edge detection using Verilog, HLS, and Cyclone V SoC, optimizing performance with HPS-FPGA communication.  

### 🔹 Verification Projects  
- **SystemVerilog Verification of FIFO & I2C**  
  - Developed testbenches, assertions (SVA), and functional coverage for digital systems.  
- **Structured Verification Environments**  
  - Created verification setups incorporating randomized stimulus, protocol adherence checks, and coverage-driven testing.  

### 🔹 RTL Design Projects  
- Designed and optimized hardware architectures using **Verilog/SystemVerilog**.  
- Experience in **timing analysis, power optimization, and placement & routing** (Cadence Innovus).  
- Worked with **protocols like UART, I2C, SPI, APB, and AMBA**.  

## Tools & Technologies Used 🛠  
- **HDLs:** Verilog, SystemVerilog  
- **EDA Tools:** Cadence Virtuoso, Innovus, Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim  
- **FPGA Platforms:** DE1-SoC (Cyclone V), Zynq-based boards  
- **Verification:** UVM, Assertions (SVA), Coverage-driven Verification
