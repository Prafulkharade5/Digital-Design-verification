# ðŸ“¡ UART Design & Testbench ðŸ›   

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This repository contains the **RTL design and verification** of a **8-bit UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**. The project follows the **ASIC Design Flow**, including RTL coding, synthesis, verification, and physical design.  



## ðŸ“¡ UART Architecture  
A **8-bit UART** is designed to facilitate serial communication between devices using **start/stop bits, baud rate control, and CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) handling**.  

### **Features**  
âœ… 16-bit data transfer  
âœ… LSB-to-MSB sequential bit transmission  
âœ… Start and stop bit synchronization  
âœ… CDC Handling for reliable data transfer  
âœ… Optimized for **ASIC Design Flow** (Cadence tools)
